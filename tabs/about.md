title: About
---

I am solution-orientated technical expert with experience delivering across a range of industries including major banking organisations, government and technology firms. 

Over the years I have worked as an Engineer, Technical Lead, Architect and Director.

I have always been passionate about technology and now I work on problems from a broader perspective to find the right solution. Today I manage a growing team of Engineers, Analysts, Testers and DevOps experts to offer solutions to a number of clients. We champion high quality, tailored solutions to tackle complex problems in a sustainable, scalable and simple way. 

My main interest is delivering high quality systems into production and getting them in the hands of real users. I believe that every project should be focused on delivering first, we need to focus on delivery and the approach or technology need to serve that goal.
