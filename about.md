title: About me
description: All about a London based software developer
---

I have been a software developer for a number of years working in London. At the moment I work for a tech consultancy and work on a wide range of projects. My time is spent on developing applications, manging dev ops projects and managing teams. 

As a tech lead on various projects I run a team and lead it as a hands on developer but also manage architecture, dev ops, production support and code standards.

My tech stack seems to be growing day by day but a few of the highlights include:

* Java
* Spring
* Jackson
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Ruby
* Amazon Web Services
* Docker
* Terraform
* Symfony
* Zend Framework
* DropWizard
* Jenkins

I'm sure there's a lot more that I've forgotten and I'll add later.

Recently completed my first Amazon exam and there will be more to follow
